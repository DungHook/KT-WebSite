                     <p><h2>A few More thoughts</h2>
                     <p>
                         I ventured into Ultima Online around the Age of shadows and although I have learned a lot
                         about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade. Just a player
                         who loves to spend time in Sosaria. So The intention here was not to reinvent the wheel,
                         just to make some changes that have frustrated me over the years,
                         with the production shards.
                     </p>

                     Total skills cap set to 800.<br />
                      The thoughts here are, we can have the standared 5 skills at 120.
                     Plus one extra skill at 80.

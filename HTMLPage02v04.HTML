                         I ventured into Ultima Online around the Age of shadows and although I have learned a lot
                         about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade. Just a player
                         who loves to spend time in Sosaria. So The intention here was not to reinvent the wheel,
                         just to make some changes that have frustrated me over the years,
                         with the production shards.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         That said, I have added some new pets and items. Take for instance  our new
                         <span class="MD" onmousemove="ShowFixed()" onmouseout="HideFixed()">Miners Dragon</span>

                         , Exclusively designed for miners.

                     <p>
                         <!--This will be the right side box <br />
                         for future use.-->
                     </p>
                 </div>
             </div> <!--End of <div class="container">-->

             <!--popup boxes--> 
             <div class="fixed"id='MDimage'>
                 <img src="images/MD03.png" alt="Oops something went horribly wrong!!!!" style="width:400px; height:400px;" />

                 <p class="box">
                     Total skills cap set to 800.<br />
                     The thoughts here are, we can have the standared 5 skills at 120.
                     Plus one extra skill at 80.

                 <p class="box">
                     If a Dexer was to invest those 80 points into say, Mage.
                      They could Max out strength and dex and still have 75 Int. 
                     To use for recall and marking ruins.

                         My thoughts are, we can have the standared<br /> 5 skills at 120.
                         Plus one extra skill at 80.

                        If a Dexer was to invest those 80 extra points into say, Mage.
                        They could Max out strength and dex and still have 75 Int. 
                        To use for recall and marking ruins.

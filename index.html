            <h4>A few thoughts</h4>
        <p> Although I have learned a lot about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade.<br />
            Just a player who loves to spend time in Sosaria. I started around the Age of shadows.</p>
        <p>	That said I have added many new pets and items.<br/>
            Take for instance  our new Miners Dragon, Exclusively designed for miners.<br/>
            Like the fire Beetle, the Miners Dragon can smelt your ore. Then hold the ingots in there Backpack.<br> 
            At a Max  hold weights of 2,000 stones you can stay out all day and not tire them out.</p>
        <p> By chance if you find yourself mining in Deciet or covetous, no worries.<br/>
            They are very loyal and as strong as there cousins, the greater dragon.<br />
            During there testing stages they performed very well at protecting there Miners, from the cowherd's (PK'rs) who sometime pray on unsuspecting miners.
            OH!! Did I mention? you can ride them home at the end, of a long day of mining...</p>

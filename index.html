                     <h2>A few thoughts</h2>
                     <p>
                         Although I have learned a lot about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade.<br />
                         Just a player who loves to spend time in Sosaria. I started around the Age of shadows.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         That said I have added many new pets and items.<br />
                         Take for instance  our new Miners Dragon, Exclusively designed for miners.<br />
                         Like the fire Beetle, the Miners Dragon can smelt your ore. Then hold the ingots in there Backpack.<br>
                         At a Max  hold weights of 2,000 stones you can stay out all day and not tire them out.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                         By chance if you find yourself mining in Deciet or covetous, no worries.<br />
                         They are very loyal and as strong as there cousins, the greater dragon.<br />
                         During there testing stages they performed very well at protecting there Miners, from the cowherd's (PK'rs) who sometime pray on unsuspecting miners.
                         OH!! Did I mention? you can ride them home at the end, of a long day of mining...

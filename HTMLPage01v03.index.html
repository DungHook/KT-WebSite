                     <p><h2>A few thoughts</h2>
                     <p>
                         I ventured into Ultima Online around the Age of shadows and although I have learned a lot 
                          about how the server side of UO is programmed. I am not A programmer by trade. Just a player 
                          who loves to spend time in Sosaria. So The intention here was not to reinvent the wheel, 
                          just to make some changes that have frustrated me over the years, 
                        with the production shards.</p>
                     <p>
                         That said, I have added some new pets and items. Take for instance  our new 
         <span class="MD" onmousemove ="ShowFixed()" onmouseout="HideFixed()">Miners Dragon</span>
 
                         , Exclusively designed for miners.<p />
                       <p>  Like the fire Beetle, the miners Dragon can smelt your ore. Then hold the ingots 
                           in there Backpack.  
                         By chance if you find yourself mining in Deciet or covetous, no worries. 
                           They are very loyal and  as strong as there cousins, the greater dragon. 
                     <p/>
                     <p>During there testing stages they performed very well at protecting there Miners,
                         from the cowherd's (PK'rs) who sometime pray on unsuspecting miners.
                        <strong>OH!! Did I mention? </strong> You can ride them home at the end, of a long day of mining...</p>

                         <h2>A description of our shard.</h2>
                         <p><strong>Old school values;</strong></p>
                     <p>
                         We have no repair deeds.<br />
                          This was done to give the crafters a stronger role in the society.<br />
                         If you need armor, or just need armor repaired, you will need to get to know a good crafter.
                         It's true, not everyone wants to invest the time into building a A good crafter. 
                         For those that do, they will build a loyal following.
                     </p>
                       <p><strong>For Dex'rs</strong> you should notice Healing with bandages is a good bit quicker.<br />
                      The time it takes to heal with Bandages has been shortened.<br />
                         East of new haven the <strong>Archery range has been renovated</strong> to accomidate all warriors. 
                     There is a place to train up to GM for archers, masers, swordsmen of all discipline and mages.
                      There is a runic Atlas in the training Fort near downtown NewHavan with a ruin there.
